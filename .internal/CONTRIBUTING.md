## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to our projects, from writing code, reporting bugs, suggesting enhancements, and more:

<br>

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the issue tracker to avoid duplicating existing issues. When filing a bug report, please provide as much relevant information as possible to help us reproduce the issue. This might include:

- Your operating system
- Steps to reproduce the bug
- Expected and actual behavior
- Any relevant logs or error messages

<br>

### Suggesting Enhancements

Feature requests are welcome. Before submitting an enhancement suggestion, please check if it's already been proposed. When suggesting enhancements, include as much detail as possible and consider the scope and objectives of our projects.

<br>

### Code Contributions

Not sure where to start? Look for issues tagged with `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted`:

- `good-first-issue` are tasks that should only require a few lines of code and minimal system understanding.
- `help-wanted` are more involved tasks needing a deeper understanding of the system.

<br>

### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Add or update tests as necessary according to your changes.
3. Ensure all tests pass.
4. Update the `README.md `with details of changes to the interface or significant functionality.
5. Submit your pull request with a comprehensive description of changes.

<br>

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Please refer to the `README.md` file for instructions on setting up your development environment to start working on our projects.

<br>

## Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests. If you've added code, please ensure it adheres to our project's coding style. Include unit tests for any new functionality and ensure that all tests pass.

<br>

## Additional Guidelines

- Write commit messages that clearly outline what has been accomplished in the commit.
- Document new code based on the project's standard.

# Code of Conduct at Urani

<br>

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

<br>

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting


<br>

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

<br>

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

<br>

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting [Mia](https://github.com/mia-stein). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
